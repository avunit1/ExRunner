### Multi installer tool

ExRunner will help you bulk-install multiple exe type installers.

# How does it work?

ExRunner will prompt you for a directory containing the exe files. It will then scan the directory for exe files and start opening them one by one for your convenience.

# Getting Started

### Let's Install

Download the latest release, unzip it using 7zip or WinRar, install the Comic Cat font, and then run the executable as administrator. Make sure you delete none of the files inside the ExRunner folder.
