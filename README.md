### Multi installer tool

ExRunner is a powerful and user-friendly tool that makes it easy for you to install multiple executables at once. With its simple and intuitive interface, you can easily navigate through the program and select the executables you wish to install.

# How does it work?

Once you have selected the files, ExRunner will automatically install them in the background, saving you time and hassle. The program also has a built-in integrity check feature that ensures that the ExRunner executable you are running has not been tampered with. This provides an added layer of security and peace of mind, ensuring that you are only running safe and verified files.

# Let's Install

Firstly, make sure you have python installed. You can grab the latest version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Next, after you install python open up CMD and type in the following command:

```sh
pip install pillow pywin32
```

After you have done this, right click the zip file you have downloaded from https://github.com/avunit1/ExRunner/releases and click extract. You can use the built-in Windows tool, or you can use a tool like WinRar or 7zip.

Once you have extracted, open the extracted folder, and run ExRunner.exe as administrator and you're done!
