### Multi installer tool

ExRunner is a powerful and user-friendly tool that makes it easy for you to install multiple executables at once. With its simple and intuitive interface, you can easily navigate through the program and select the executables you wish to install.

# How does it work?

Once you have selected the files, ExRunner will automatically install them in the background, saving you time and hassle. 

# Let's Install

Firstly, make sure you have python installed. You can grab the latest version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Next, after you install python open up CMD and type in the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After you have done this, right click the zip file you have downloaded from https://github.com/avunit1/ExRunner/releases and click extract. You can use the built-in Windows tool, or you can use a tool like WinRar or 7zip.

Once you have extracted, open the extracted folder, and run ExRunner.exe as administrator and you're done! Also, if you wish to run the main source file from CMD, please run cmd.exe with administrator privileges and cd into the directory the .py file is located, otherwise it will not run. 

# VirusTotal Scans

For your safety and peace of mind, I have included VirusTotal scans of both the executable file and the python file. If you wish, you can also check the file hashes to see if they match with the ones found in the VirusTotal scan.
